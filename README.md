## Assignments

### Offline 1: Preprocessing
Path: [Offline 1](./Offline%201)

In this assignment, various preprocessing steps were implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The tasks include:
- Data cleaning
- Normalization and standardization
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical data

### Offline 2: Logistic Regression and Stacking Ensemble
Path: [Offline 2](./Offline%202)

This assignment involves implementing:
- **Logistic Regression**: A fundamental binary classification algorithm coded from scratch.
- **Stacking Ensemble**: Combining multiple models to improve predictive performance. The performance of the models was analyzed on two datasets.

### Offline 3: Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
Path: [Offline 3](./Offline%203)

In this assignment, a **Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)** was built from scratch using Python. The network was trained and evaluated on the Fashion MNIST dataset, covering:
- Implementation of forward and backward propagation.
- Training using gradient descent.
- Analysis of performance metrics.

### Offline 4: PCA and EM Algorithm
Path: [Offline 4](./Offline%204)

This assignment consists of two tasks:
1. **PCA Analysis**:
   - Principal Component Analysis was performed to reduce the dimensionality of a provided dataset.
   - Analysis of explained variance and visualization of the transformed data.

2. **EM Algorithm**:
   - Implementation of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for clustering on another dataset.
   - Analysis of convergence and performance.
